    <p>I got into web development out of curiosity â€“ I needed a website for my band. This sparked my interest in programming, and today, I have had the pleasure of working as a developer at a <a href="https://www.thesistesting.com/" class="text-magenta hover:text-green">growth marketing agency</a> in Brooklyn, NY as well as contributing to a number of freelance projects.
    <br/><br/>Working in a startup environment turned me into something of a generalist with exposure to many elements of the web development stack. These days my main focus is on cloud computing. I received my AWS Developer Associate certification in 2023 and currently I'm looking for work related to the cloud.</p>
