    <p>I got into web development out of curiosity, as I needed a website for a band. This sparked my interest in programming, and after self studies online and a bootcamp course, I landed my first full time developer job at a growth marketing agency in New York City.
    <br/><br/>More recently, while working on some music projects, I became interested in cloud computing. I received my AWS Developer Associate certification in 2023, and currently, I'm looking for work related to the cloud.</p>
