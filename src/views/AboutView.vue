  <div class="about">
    <p>I got into web development because I needed a website for a band. After learning how to manipulate Wordpress themes I wanted to learn more, and after online studies and a bootcamp course, I spent a few years building landing pages and various solutions for clients at a startup in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>More recently, while working on some music projects, I became interested in cloud computing. I received my AWS Developer Associate certification in 2023. At the moment, I'm looking for work that relates to the cloud.</p>
